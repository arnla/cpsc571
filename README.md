# CPSC571

## Application Requirements

### Visual Studio

Please have a version of Visual Studio that is compatible with C# ASP.NET installed to run the application.

### MongoDB

Our application uses a local MongoDB database. Please download and install MongoDB on your computer and start an instance of it.

### Twitter Keys

Since we use the Twitter API, the application requires a developer account. With this developer account, you will have access to
keys and access tokens. On lines 16-19 of cpsc571/Helpers/TwitterStream.cs, you will need to add these keys and tokens to use the
Twitter streaming API.
